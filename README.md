DOLfYN is the Doppler Oceanography Library for pYthoN.

DOLfYN includes libraries for reading Nortek(tm) and Teledyne-RDI(tm) data files (e.g. ADV, ADP and ADCP files).  If you have a data file of one of these formats that is not read by DOLfYN, contact the DOLfYN development team.  If you have suggestions of other data-file formats that should be added to DOLfYN, contact the development team.

DOLfYN includes a data abstraction layer that enables saving and loading of data after it has been read from the binary files and modified/added-to.
